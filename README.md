# Previous Wind Turbine (module-0)

In this module:

* You will re-familiarize yourself with the wind turbine from the last lab.
  Recall, it has an adversary container and a Grafana container for ground
  truth.

In the next module, you will set up this wind turbine in a larger wind farm.
Change the two `{{FIX_ME}}` entries in the URL below with the values provided by
your instructor. Then, start the next branch.

# Connecting Your Turbine to the Wind Farm (module-1)

In this module:

* You will confirm access to the lab’s wind farm.

## Steps for Connecting to the Wind Farm

1. Ensure all containers are running in the Gitpod workspace.
2. Confirm with the lab instructor that your wind turbine is connected to the
   farm.
3. Feather the turbine blades and confirm with the instructor that they are
   visible.

Use the `{{FIX_ME}}` values from the previous module in the URL below. Then,
start the next module.
